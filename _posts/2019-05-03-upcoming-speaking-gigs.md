### XP2019

[Intentional Learning - Map a Successful Strategy](https://xp2019.sched.com/event/MeQJ/intentional-learning-map-a-successful-strategy-claire-moss)

As agile team members, we are committed to learning. However, often our learning is opportunistic and unplanned: we chase the latest shiny thing and gain broad but shallow knowledge. In a workshop inspired by Dan North and Chris Matt's work in skills mapping, you will chart your own learning adventure based on where you are now and where you want to be in the future.

Intro - Overview of current learning landscape. Outside of a degree or certification program, learning requires individual planning and a tiny bit of discipline. I'll present an outline of the technique we'll follow for this workshop and highlight results from applying this technique with 2 different teams.

Skills Mapping and Self-Evaluation - Attendees will self-evaluate their skills in two realms - skills needed by their teams and skills they'd like for their own professional advancement (a little 2008 but essential to set the stage for the remaining 2 parts). The presenters will provide some sample skills list for different agile roles as a starting point.

Learning / Mastery Objectives - Attendees will review some example skills maps, then analyze their skills map and choose which skills they would like to augment or acquire and what level of mastery they would like to achieve

Map your strategy. - There are many different ways to approach learning. However, being intentional about what you learn and how you approach it means you increase your odds of success. I'll briefly highlight the latest research in learning styles and today's popular methods. Attendees will identify concrete next steps to take on their individual learning adventure, with the table group contributing ideas and experience.


Learning Outcomes:
- Identify skills desired for your personal professional benefit.
- Identify skills that are important to your team's success.
- Select target skills and determine desired mastery levels.
- Select learning activities to begin progress towards desired mastery level.



[It's a MAD world! Contract Testing can help!](https://xp2019.sched.com/event/MeRK/its-a-mad-world-contract-testing-can-help-claire-moss)

APIs as products and microservices as a design pattern have become our day-to-day reality.
With more moving parts comes more complexity and a greater need for understanding. Developers and Product Managers need early warning signs that deployment is a bad idea.
Enter contract testing. (No, not the "contract negotiation" mentioned in the Agile Manifesto...)
Provider teams building API products collaborate with the consumer teams who are their customers to determine information needs. This negotiation works out in various ways that result in interface agreements between the teams.
Join Claire for an interactive exploration of contract testing as a feedback technique. Enable greater focus on the individuals and interactions. Make responding to the changes of this MAD world easier!

Learning Outcomes:
- Relate familiar communication patterns to this new technology practice
- Identify the problem that contract testing addresses
- Understand different kinds of contract testing
- Discuss different implementations of solutions
- See a demo in code
- Be able to explain the value of the practice on the first day back at the office
- Deploy API products more easily!

### Mile High Agile 2019

[Everything You Wanted To Know About DevOps But Were Afraid To Ask](https://confengine.com/mile-high-agile-2019/schedule)

As a career software tester, I’ve heard rumors DevOps culture will put me out of a job, so I took a job testing for a DevOps team. I’m new to DevOps, but aren’t we all? What matters most is our teams’ intentional decisions to grow our DevOps practices along with our development community.

Join me as I share my experiences blending disciplines, companies, levels of experience, and differing expectations as a member of efficient and effective delivery teams. I’ll describe common cultural and interpersonal problems I experienced while transforming a cross-functional agile team dogfooding a DevOps implementation.

Whether you’re into development, operations, testing, customer support, or product ownership, you’ll leave with concrete strategies for improving your DevOps working relationships to keep the technology running smoothly. People factors strongly affect your DevOps technical outcomes, so optimizing your flow includes improving your people practices.

Don’t feel afraid to ask about DevOps anymore!
